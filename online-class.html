                    <h1>Step 1: To start online classes define your training goals</h1>
                    <p>

                        The purpose of launching your online classes should be clear. Determine your business metric and
                        the
                        impact you want to create through the courses. If you are an established business you could be
                        taking online classes for different purposes. For example, one of the reasons could be to train
                        your
                        clients about how to use certain tools.<br><br>

                        <b>Business goal:</b> Define what are the financial and other growth outcomes you expect to
                        bring into your
                        business through your courses.<br><br>
                        <b>Teaching Goal:</b> Define the teaching goals behind the launch of your course. Whether to
                        help your
                        clients master a tool or to teach a subject or help your customers use your products
                        better.<br><br>
                        <b>Learning objectives:</b> You need to clearly define what your learners will achieve by the
                        end of the
                        course.
                    </p>

                    <h1>Step 2: Outline your online classes</h1>
                    <p>Divide the whole module into folders and sub-folders, containing topics and sub-topics. While
                        planning out the whole module, keep in mind the learning objective.

                        Keep yourself in the place of the learners and try to determine the flow of your course content
                        that would be most effective. <br><br>

                        Plan out a combination of the form of content that would be more
                        engaging. Our educators who create audiovisual content like videos or teach online live classes
                        have apparently seen higher engagement.<br><br>

                        Once you are done with the module planning, establish a tentative delivery timeline for those
                        content. Make sure you document them.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Step 3: Build your online course content</h1>
                    <p>The real work comes into play at this step.
                        You would start creating online course content at this step. However, the process need not be
                        time-consuming.</p>
                    <h1>Step 4: Engage your target learners</h1>
                    <p>
                        Now that you are done with the substantial part of creating online classes, it’s time to deliver
                        it to your target audience. You have to plan on how to effectively deliver your course to your
                        learners. The accessibility of your course is just as important as the content itself. If
                        learners can’t access your course, they would never be able to see the course content.<br><br>

                        By “accessibility” we’re referring to a learner’s first encounter with the course. It could be
                        the course link or landing page. Structure the process of discovering your course of buying them
                        in a way that is easy to navigate and value-filled.
